# Multicast Chat Applications

Applications to chat through the network using multicast IP addresses.

The applications are compatible with both `IPv4` and `IPv6`, and use the `asyncio` library for the server part.

One application uses the `Textual` TUI, the other uses the `Qt` GUI.

There is an optional message encoding using `Base64`.
